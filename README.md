## **Objectives**
- Provide personalized video game recommendations based on user preferences.
- Create an interactive and user-friendly chatbot interface.
- Use machine learning (TensorFlow/Keras) and natural language processing (NLTK) to understand user input and generate responses.
- Demonstrate the integration of Flask for web development and Python for backend logic.

---

## **Features**
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can type messages and receive game recommendations.
- **Game Recommendations:** The bot recommends games based on user input (e.g., platform, genre).
- **Clickable Links:** Game names are clickable and redirect to a Google search for more information.
- **Typing Effect:** Bot responses appear as if they are being typed.
- **Stylish UI:** A modern and visually appealing interface with animations.

---

## **Pros and Cons**

### **Pros**
- **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for users.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Tailored game suggestions based on user input.
- **Scalable:** Can be extended to include more games, genres, and platforms.
- **Interactive:** Typing effect and clickable links enhance user engagement.

### **Cons**
- **Limited Dataset:** The bot's recommendations are based on a predefined dataset (`intents.json`).
- **No Persistence:** Chat history is not saved between sessions.
- **Dependency on External APIs:** Clickable links rely on Google search.

---

## **Future Use**
- **Expand Dataset:** Add more games, genres, and platforms to the `intents.json` file.
- **User Profiles:** Allow users to create profiles and save their preferences.
- **Integration with Game Stores:** Redirect users to platforms like Steam, Epic Games, or PlayStation Store.
- **Advanced NLP:** Use more advanced NLP techniques (e.g., transformers) for better understanding of user input.
- **Mobile App:** Develop a mobile app version of the chatbot.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Create a Virtual Environment**
To isolate the project dependencies, create a virtual environment.

#### **On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### **On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy nltk flask matplotlib
```

#### **Additional Setup for NLTK**
Download the necessary NLTK data by running the following Python commands:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

---

### **3. Run the Application**
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the chatbot interface.
